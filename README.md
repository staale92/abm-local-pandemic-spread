# An Agent-Based Model of the Local Spread of SARS-CoV-2: Modeling Study
Implementation of "An Agent-Based Model of the Local Spread of SARS-CoV-2: Modeling Study". The model is intended to be a simple and flexible tool to analyze the interaction between healthy and infected individuals, and to compare the effects of different policies (such as wearing face masks, imposing social distance, etc.) to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
The model considers a sample of the population of four countries (Italy, Germany, Sweden, and Brazil), fixed at 1000 agents. In the model panel, we can select one of the four countries: this loads the demographic characteristics of the population and the government measures (implemented with their timing of issuance with respect to the spread of the pandemic).
